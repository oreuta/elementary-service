# Swagger

     Swagger is a project used to describe and document RESTful APIs.
======================================================================
- **A bit of a theory**
-----------------------
Swagger is an open source software framework backed by a large ecosystem of tools that helps developers design,
build, document, and consume RESTful Web services. While most users identify Swagger by the Swagger UI tool,
the Swagger toolset includes support for automated documentation, code generation, and test case generation.
The Swagger specification defines a set of files required to describe such an API.
These files can then be used by the Swagger-UI project to display the API and Swagger-Codegen to generate
clients in various languages.
Additional utilities can also take advantage of the resulting files, such as testing tools.
A RESTful API is an application program interface (API) that uses HTTP requests to GET, PUT, POST and DELETE data.
A RESTful API -- also referred to as a RESTful web service -- is based on representational state transfer (REST)
technology, an architectural style and approach to communications often used in web services development.
